# ** Deep Learning Project: Street View House Number (SVHN) Digit Recognition **
Context
Object
Recognition in natural scenes is one of the most compelling and widely applied challenges in the field of deep learning. The ability of models to interpret and classify images captured in real-world environments—such as busy streets, cluttered backgrounds, or poor lighting—demonstrates the power of deep learning in computer vision applications.
In this project, we focus on the SVHN (Street View House Numbers) dataset, which consists of over 600,000 digit images extracted from real-world street-level photographs. Each image is centered on a digit from an address number captured on building facades, similar to the ones seen on Google Street View. SVHN is a well-known benchmark in the computer vision community and has been used by companies like Google to enhance the quality of digital maps by automatically extracting and transcribing address numbers from street images. This digit recognition task is critical in associating visual information (e.g., a number on a house) with geolocation data, thereby improving the accuracy of digital navigation tools.
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop deep learning models that can accurately recognize and classify the digit displayed in each image. We aim to achieve this using both Fully Connected Neural Networks (also known as Artificial Neural Networks) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We will build and evaluate multiple model architectures from both families, analyze their performance, and select the one that yields the best accuracy and generalization on unseen data. This task not only demonstrates how neural networks can handle image-based inputs but also highlights the superiority of CNNs in capturing spatial patterns and features within image data.
Dataset:
To ensure efficiency in training and evaluation, we will use a smaller subset of the original SVHN dataset, which is available in a preprocessed format as an .h5 file. The dataset has already undergone basic preprocessing steps such as normalization and resizing, making it ready for input into our neural network models. Each image in the dataset represents a single digit, and the labels correspond to the actual digit values from 0 to 9. This setup allows us to frame the problem as a multi-class classification task.
